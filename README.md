TAKER OF NOTES

Using JS and Node.js, this app creates a note-taker, or taker of notes, where a user can store notes over time even after leaving the site. The user can return and delete notes later as well.

Use npm install in your terminal as well as express and uuid packages to assign ID's and to get the server running.
